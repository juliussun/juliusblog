I'm a programmer on the road. 

Many years ago, when I was still a kid, the first language I had the chance to encounter is BASIC. From that moment, this eye-openning feeling rooted deeply. But like many things in life, good things somehow got faded away.

However, for many years during my career in other disciplines, it kept coming back to haunt me when I actually used it from time to time, to liberate me from routine jobs or to excite me when surrounded by predictables. Coding helped me achieve something big and different in an unexpected way. I invested countless days into it, tirelessly. Then it came to a point where I finally gave up. I needed to rethink my path.

I consider my early career a good one. But it was a hiatus after all. This has been the new me.
